# Docsflip

Docsflip is a digital publishing platform that converts PDF documents into interactive flipbooks for the East African market.

This repository is the **single source of truth** for what Docsflip is, what will be built, and how it must be built.

---

## ⚠️ Important — Read Before Doing Anything

If you are a developer or AI coding agent:

**Do not write code.  
Do not scaffold a project.  
Do not suggest features.**

You must first read **all documents listed below**, in the order shown.

---

## Repository Structure and Authority

This repository contains three authoritative documents:

### 1. `Docsflip_AI_Agent_Kickoff_Prompt.md`
**Read first. Always.**

Defines:
- Your role and responsibilities
- How decisions are made
- What you must confirm before building
- How you communicate with the product owner
- What not to assume

This document governs **how you work**.

---

### 2. `Docsflip_MVP_Product_Brief_v2.md`
Defines:
- What Docsflip is
- Who it is for
- MVP feature scope (and exclusions)
- Pricing logic
- Go-to-market priorities

This document governs **what is built**.

---

### 3. `Docsflip_Technical_Implementation_Guide.md`
Defines:
- The exact technology stack
- Folder structure
- Database schema
- Cloud Functions
- Security rules
- Performance constraints
- Build order

This document governs **how it is built**.

---

## Order of Authority (No Exceptions)

If there is a conflict:

1. **Technical Implementation Guide** overrides everything on technical matters
2. **MVP Product Brief** overrides everything on product scope
3. **AI Agent Kickoff Prompt** overrides everything on process and behavior

If something is not explicitly covered, **stop and ask**.

---

## Build Status

- This is a **clean build**
- There is **no existing codebase**
- The GitHub repository is intentionally minimal at this stage
- All implementation starts only after confirmation from the product owner

---

## How to Proceed (For Developers / Agents)

1. Read all three documents fully
2. Confirm understanding in plain language
3. Ask for clarification if anything is unclear
4. Wait for explicit approval before starting Priority 1

Failure to follow this order will result in rework.
